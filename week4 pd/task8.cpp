/*
Write a program that reads the number of holidays and passes it to the function named
pet(int holidays) and the function then prints whether Tom can sleep well and how much
the difference from the current yearâ€™s norm. It is assumed that there are 365 days in one
year.

		Above we are using two times subtraction operator

		from negative value gives us positive value.
		Applying this two time can give us the exact 
		same value but with positive sign.
